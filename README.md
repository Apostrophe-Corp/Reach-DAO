# Reach DAO

This project was created for the decentralized Umoja3 Bounty hack, organized by Reach, the African Blockchain Alliance and Algorand.

The DApp allows any user to create a proposal for other users to contribute to and vote on. If the proposal passes, it becomes a bounty funded by the contributions as well as funds raised from sponsors. If the proposal does not pass, all users who contributed can claim a refund on the amounts that each of them contributed. 
We envision that a proposal could be a fullscale Dapp, A part of a Dapp, A tutorial, or frameworks or tools that make building with reach easier and faster for developers. We do not limit proposals to this and look forward to creative ways users use our DApp.
The central idea behind the Reach DAO is to allow projects to be executed or actualized faster by incentivising them via bounties while also providing an avenue for Reach Developers to gain much needed experience and expertise and earn money while doing this. 
The end game is for the Reach DAO to be a hub for Reach developers with the benefit of the Reach community in mind, and we hope that users create proposals with this in mind.
Those who are not developers but have projects that they amy want to execute are also invited to create proposals.

## Getting Started

### Pre-requisites and Local Development

Developers using this Dapp should already have Reach, Docker and Node installed on their local machines.
####The guides for installations can be found below:

[Instructions for installing Reach and Docker](https://docs.reach.sh/quickstart/#qs-win-install)
[Instructions for installing Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 

In addition, they should have an Algorand wallet (preferably Pera Algo Wallet) installed on their phone and loaded with Testnet Algos in order to be able to sign transactions and contribute to proposals. The wallet can be installed from the App store (i-Phone) or Google Play as is appropiate.
